"""
Example 1.18. Slicing shorthand
-------------------------------
(1) If the left slice index is 0, you can leave it out, and 0 is implied. So li[:3] is the same as li[0:3]
from the previous example.

(2) Similarly, if the right slice index is the length of the list, you can leave it out. So li[3:] is the same as
li[3:5], because this list has 5 elements.

(3) Note the symmetry here. In this 5âˆ’element list, li[:3] returns the first 3 elements, and li[3:] returns
the last 2 elements. In fact, li[:n] will always return the first n elements, and li[n:] will return the
rest, regardless(independientemente) of the length of the list.

(4) If both slice indices are left out, all elements of the list are included. But this is not the same as the
original li list; it is a new list that happens to have all the same elements. li[:] is a shorthand for
making a complete copy of a list.
